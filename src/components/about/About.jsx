        If I am not writing code or snooping through open source projects
        breaking a few things as I try to figure out how they work you will find
        me on my hobbies. I enjoy stkateboarding and listening to old school rap
        songs, the likes of Fat Joe and Rick Ross (I know I have refused to
        evolve). I also enjoy exploring, trying out new stuff and dissecting
        Kendric Lamar's lyrics.
