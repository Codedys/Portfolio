          I'm a Software Engineer by training and trade. I spend most of my time reading books about tech, self-help, fiction, and philosophy. If you find this interesting, welcome to my domain. This is the space where I share insights from my personal experiences as a junior software engineer, showcase some cool projects I'm building, post technical articles, and write about general life adventures.

      <h3>Career</h3>
      <div className="career">
      I'm currently in my final year at Kenyatta University, pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I work part-time at Keypad Solutions and I am currently available for full-time or contract roles ðŸ™‚. Over the course of my four years at university, I've worked on personal projects ranging from CLI tools to fullstack applications. I enjoy bringing ideas to life and  I am looking to establish myself in data engineering, with a goal of becoming a machine learning engineer. If you're interested, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or send me an email.

      <h3>Life</h3>
      <div className="life">
      If I'm not writing code or exploring open-source projects (and breaking a few things as I try to figure out how they work), you'll find me enjoying my hobbies. I love skateboarding and listening to old-school rap artists like Fat Joe and Rick Ross (I know, I've refused to evolve). I also enjoy exploring, trying out new things, and dissecting Kendrick Lamar's lyrics.
